# Bootcamp Mini Project - Tic Tack Toe

## Description 

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery to make a Tic Tac Toe Game. The project had the following requirements:

* You choose a symbol. The empty symbol is AI vs AI
* If it is the human players turn, the relevant empty boxes can be pressed only.
* The player cannot move on the AIs turn.
* The AI only goes on its turn
* The game ends when there are three of the same symbol in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonially), or there are no moves left.
* The AI should pick and optimal choice.

The page in this repo is the result.
